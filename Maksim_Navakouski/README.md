My Assignments, Day 02:

My Colab Notebook -> https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pWWKi7pUtv0b8lye0WeZ7ym54sSVPshl#scrollTo=Bx1o0zWwOrjX
the link to the text summarizator -> https://7f89fce11b5b7d146b.gradio.live

Is it correct, that I need to create and use my private token (hf_xxx...x) newly generated by the Hugging Face after signing up ??? 
Because the API Key I received to my e-mail is from OpenRouter - I used it for the BONUS section.
